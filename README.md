There are various formats for a dataset: .csv, .json, .xlsx  etc. The dataset can be stored in different places, on your local machine or sometimes online.<br>

In this section, you will learn how to load a dataset into our Jupyter Notebook.<br>

In our case, the Automobile Dataset is an online source, and it is in a CSV (comma separated value) format. Let's use this dataset as an example to practice data reading.

<ul>
    <li>Data source: <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDA0101ENSkillsNetwork20235326-2021-01-01" target="_blank">https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data</a></li>
    <li>Data type: csv</li>
</ul>
The Pandas Library is a useful tool that enables us to read various datasets into a dataframe; our Jupyter notebook platforms have a built-in <b>Pandas Library</b> so that all we need to do is import Pandas without installing.
